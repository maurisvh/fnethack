fNetHack
========

**fNetHack** is a NetHack fork, based on [nethack.alt.org's version](
https://github.com/kerio92/nh343-nao) of the game (which is just NetHack
3.4.3 with a bunch of interface patches). It aims to still feel and play
like vanilla NetHack, but removes or rebalances certain elements of the
game to make it more interesting and less tedious.

If you're used to regular old NetHack, certain changes might be surprising
to you: most notably, *Elbereth* is gone, making tactical combat and running
away much more important than it once was; to make up for it, player
characters are a bit more robust, and regenerate health more quickly. Many
other items, enemies, or mechanics have been changed or removed to
accomodate this change. The endgame is much shorter, and the XL cap is at
15 instead of 30.

A more elaborate list of changes will follow; for now, you should look at
the [commits page](https://github.com/maurisvh/fnethack/commits/master).

If you have any comments, questions, or other feedback, you can connect to
on [`irc.freenode.org`](webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##fnethack) and talk
about the game in `##fnethack` (I'm *mauris* there.)

Good luck!
